# Transit Ridership Forecasting with TensorFlow

This project analyzes and forecasts transit ridership data using various time series modeling techniques, with a focus on TensorFlow-based models.

## Overview

The goal is to build accurate and interpretable models to predict future transit ridership based on historical trends. The project includes:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Implementation of multiple forecasting models:
  - Prophet (Facebook)
  - SARIMA (`statsmodels`)
  - Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)
  - TensorFlow-based deep learning models (e.g., LSTM)
- Model comparison and evaluation

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Prophet
- statsmodels
- pandas / NumPy
- matplotlib / seaborn
